Description
-----------

This project contains an easy-to-use powerful n-dimensional histogram class implemented in ``C++0x``, optimized for convenience and excellent performance under heavy duty. The histogram has a complete C++ and a `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ interface, and can be moved over the language boundary with ease. `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ is fully supported; histograms can be filled with Numpy arrays at C speeds and are convertible into Numpy arrays without copying data. Histograms can be streamed from/to files and pickled in Python.

My goal is to submit this project to the `Boost Libraries <http://www.boost.org Boost>`_.
