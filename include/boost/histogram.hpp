/**
 * \file boost/histogram.hpp
   \brief Includes all the non-experimental headers of the Boost.histogram library.

   The library consists of a single \ref boost::histogram::histogram "histogram"
   and several axis types which are stored in a
   boost::variant called \ref boost::histogram::axis_type "axis_type"
   The axis types are created and passed to the constructor of the
   histogram to define its binning scheme.
   All following types are embedded in the
   \ref boost::histogram  namespace, which is omitted for brevity.
